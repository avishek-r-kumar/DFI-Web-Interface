DFI Web Interface: Dynamic Flexibliiy Index Web Interface
=========================================================

## Description
Dynamic flexibility index (DFI) is a measure of each residue’s contribution to a protein’s dynamics, where blue is the lowest (most rigid) and red is the highest (most flexible). Traditionally, proteins were thought to obey the sequence-structure-function paradigm—the function of a protein is embedded in its structure. The new paradigm is the sequence-structure encoded-dynamics-functions paradigm—a protein’s structure encodes its dynamics, which encodes its function, leading to a deeper understanding of protein function. Our proteome-wide conformational dynamics analysis using DFI indicates that certain sites play a critical role in functionally related dynamics (i.e., those with low dfi values), therefore, mutations at those sites are more likely to be associated with disease.
