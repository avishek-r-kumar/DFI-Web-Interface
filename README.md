ProView: Visual Exploratory Analysis of Protein Structure
=========================================================

## Description

ProView is an interactive visualizer for protein structure and numerical
properties. It was designed to aid researchers during the exploratory phase of
their projects as they try to correlate some numerical properties with the 3D
structure of their model. 

## Underlying technologies

ProView is built on Boostrap, D3, and a modified version of iview WebGL protein visualizer.
